# Password-Secure
This Program will encrypt your Passwords. I started coding a few month ago, so the program isn´t good. The program is written in C# and you can create an .exe following these steps password Secure>Password Secure(finished)>bin>Release>netcoreapp.3.1 create a shortcut of Pasword Secure(finished).exe and drag it on your Desktop. First time starting the Program will immediatly crash (I couldn´t fix this problem) but after that it should work fine. To enter your Passwords you msut go to C:>Password Secure>nothing.txt there you can write down your Passwords. The Program will remember if the passwords are encrypted or not, so you can´t encrypt or decrypt the data twice. I hope you will find use for the program and if you have any advices or tipps I´m happy to hear them.
